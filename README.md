"# Customer-Engagement-Analysis-for-365-Data-Science" 

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:
I applied the AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and STDEV.S Excel functions to the ‘minutes_watched’ column to compute the mean, median, and standard deviation for both groups (free- and paid-plan students).
 
SKEWNESS AND KURTOSIS:
I applied the SKEW AND KURT function to compute the skewness and kurtosis for both groups (free- and paid-plan students).

CONFIDENCE INTERVALS:
I used the z-statistic to perform calculations for confidence intervals to determine the minute interval within which we can be 95% confident that a randomly selected student will be situated for both groups of students who engaged in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022.

HYPOTHESIS TESTING (Q4/21 VS Q4/22):
Performed a two-sample f-test for variances to proof the assumption of unequal variances.
performed a two-sample t-test to test the null hypothesis that the engagement (minutes watched) in Q4 2021 is higher than or equal to the one in Q4 2022 (μ1 ≥ μ2).

HYPOTHESIS TESTING (US VS India): 
Performed a two-sample f-test for variances to proof the assumption of unequal variances.
performed a two-sample t-test to test the null hypothesis that the engagement (minutes watched) in the US is higher than or equal to that in India (μUS ≥ μIN).
